        - group 
        - priority 
        - details 
        - deadline

    5) SORTING once clicking on appropriate table header, ASC and DESC 
        
        - by id 
        - by task execution status 
        - by priority 
        - by group name 
        - by deadlines 
        - by creation date

        Total tasks = number of tasks 
        Done = number of tasks with status "done" 
        Priority-0 = number of tasks with priority 0 
        Priority-1 = number of tasks with priority 1 
        ...
        Priority-10 = number of tasks with priority 10 
        Groups = count of groups 
        Latest deadline = @id of task with (date of latest deadline) 
        Closest deadline = @id of task with (date of closest deadline) 
        Mostly changed = @id of task with longest history (number of changes)
